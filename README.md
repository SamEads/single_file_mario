# single file mario

### about:
i wanted to create a simple mario game in a single file. here's the work in progress of that! the idea is to attempt to improve on my organization / heirarchy skills. oh, and to work on passing necessary local contexts instead of using a ton of globals.

### compiling:
```

cd build
cmake ..
make
